# KV Storage

KV storage (short for "key/value storage") was a proposed web API to provide a simple, asynchronous key/value store, layered on top of IndexedDB. Please check out [previous revisions of this repository](https://github.com/WICG/kv-storage/tree/7c553add86e6166820c29acf79abfc23ebbf8737) to learn more about it.

This proposal is currently inactive as no browser vendors are investing in it.
